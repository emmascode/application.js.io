Using HTML, CSS and Javascript, I created an app to convert different currencies. The app allows users to enter the amount to convert and the currency to convert from/to. Using API allows for accurate and real-time conversion.

API: v6.exchangerate-api.com

The app is hosted on Firebase following the below steps: 

Install NodeJs: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once Node is installed, install google firebase tools in your computer npm install -g firebase-tools

Google console link https://console.firebase.google.com/

Login to firebase firebase login 
Successfully log in a Google account

Change directory to the project folder 
cd dirto your project folder

Initialize project Once you are in your project folder
firebase init

Deploy Project Create a public folder and paste all your files in there, once that is done use "firebase deploy" to deploy your project
