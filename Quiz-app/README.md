Using HTML, CSS and Javascript, I created an quiz to test your CS terminology. The app allows user to choose one option for each questions, show correct answers and calculate total points earned for each correct one. The quiz has time bar to show time limit (15s) and count down for each question. After each game, user can choose to replay or exit.

I hosted the app on Firebase by following the below steps:

Install NodeJs: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once Node is installed, install google firebase tools in your computer npm install -g firebase-tools

Google console link https://console.firebase.google.com/

Login to firebase firebase login Successfully log in a Google account

Change directory to the project folder cd dirto your project folder

Initialize project Once you are in your project folder firebase init

Deploy Project Create a public folder and paste all your files in there, once that is done use "firebase deploy" to deploy your project
