Using HTML, CSS and Javascript, I created a note app and deployed it on Firebase. The app has features like: add a new note with date, update previous notes and delete old notes.

The app is hosted on Firebase following the below steps:
Install NodeJs: 
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once Node is installed, install google firebase tools in your computer
npm install -g firebase-tools

Google console link
https://console.firebase.google.com/

Login to firebase
firebase login
Successfully log in a Google account 

Change directory to the project folder
cd dirto your project folder

Initialize project
Once you are in your project folder, use "firebase init" to initialize your project.

Deploy Project
Create a public folder and paste all your files in there, once that is done use "firebase deploy" to deploy your project
